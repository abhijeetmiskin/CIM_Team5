# 🛣️ Traffic Sign Classification - CIM_Team5

This project trains a deep learning model to classify **Normal** and **Damaged** traffic signs using **TensorFlow**.  
It includes **data preparation**, **model training**, and **evaluation** scripts.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhijeetmiskin/CIM_Team5.git
cd CIM_Team5
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed, then run:
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

*(If you face issues with `tensorflow`, install the CPU version:)*  
```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.16.1
```

## 📊 Step-by-Step Usage

### **Step 1 — Prepare Dataset**
Place your original dataset in the desired folder structure:
```
dataset/
│── normal_signs/
│── damaged_signs/
```
Then run:
```bash
python split_dataset.py
```
This will create:
```
train/
│── normal_signs/
│── damaged_signs/

test/
│── normal_signs/
│── damaged_signs/
```

---

### **Step 2 — Train the Model**
Run:
```bash
python load.py
```
- Trains a **MobileNetV2**-based classifier (transfer learning)
- Saves the **best model** as `best_traffic_sign_model.h5`
- Shows **accuracy/loss plots**

---

### **Step 3 — Evaluate the Model**
After training, evaluation happens automatically.  
You’ll see:
- **Test Accuracy & Loss**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- **Confusion Matrix**

---

## 🧠 Model Details
- **Base Model:** MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Image Size:** 150×150
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.001)
- **Callbacks:**
  - EarlyStopping
  - ModelCheckpoint (save best model)
